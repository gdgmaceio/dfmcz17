## 1. Please, tell a bit about the work you do. How did you first get involved into this work?

I’m a front-end developer, working mostly on the JS side of things, because that’s what I really like doing. My story is actually funny because originally I wanted to be a dancer. I got my bachelor’s degree in Computer Science when I was still living back home, but once graduated I decided I wanted to go for my dancing dream, so I did. After completing my dance education I decided to go back to programming, which I have been doing ever since.

## 2. What is your favorite thing about your job?

Figuring out how to solve a problem with code and then actually solving it.


## 3. Do you have any advice for someone interested in pursuing the same career?

YES!! Don’t ever get discouraged! Remember along your learning path that software engineering is hard and takes time to master. There will be times when things just won’t fall into place, or you will feel overwhelmed and inadequate to do this job. In those moments just remember that none of it is a reflection of your abilities. It is just part of the learning process and ALL of us go through it to some extent.

Yeap, ALL of us! So just be patient with yourself and take it one small step at a time and you will see that there is sunshine waiting for you on the other side ^.^

Oh, and if you ever get the chance, you should visit the Exploratorium in San Francisco. It will help you understand why engineering is such a beautiful and amazing science. Either that or it will change your mind into becoming a physicist ;)

## 4. What is the most challenging part of your work, and what is the most rewarding one?

I think one of the greater challenges in this line of work is staying up to date. Our field is very complex and every week there will be yet another ten new different things to learn, which can be overwhelming at times...at least in the front-end scene of the past few years. In such a fast paced environment, I think learning how and what to learn becomes very important and having that figured out will most likely help you be a more centered developer. It took me a while to understand this and I’m still working on getting better at it :P

The most rewarding part is helping people with the code that you wrote. Without any doubt, that! For me personally, if my work doesn’t help the others in some way, then I’m doing something wrong.

## 5. Can you give us a sneak peek into your  GDG Devfest Ukraine talk? Why did you choose this subject?

I’m going to go all mysterious on you with this one :P. The only thing I want to say about it is that I’m hoping to live code something very funny with the help of the attendees. Fingers crossed ;)


## 6. How do you prefer to spend your free time?

I like travelling very much, so whenever I can I try to go somewhere new. The best travels, however, are those that take me to my far-away friends and the even better ones are those in which I’m travelling with them.

## 7. What do you think will be the next big trend in the industry in the next few years?

AI and Machine Learning!! I really believe that’s where the future is and we already have so much of the present to confirm that.


## 8. In your opinion, what are the benefits of attending events like GDG DevFest Ukraine?

Meeting amazing people, learning new and interesting things and hopefully building lasting friendships, which has in fact happened to me at DevFest NL.
