Today we start the series of interviews with our speakers, and the first one we are happy to introduce is Yonatan Levin - of the top Israeli mobile developers, who is also a part of an elite worldwide group of Google Developer Experts. His primary expertise is Android and Mobile UX, but is also friendly to backend technologies and people in general :)

So, let's start!

## 1. Hello, Yonatan! Please, tell a bit about the work you do. How did you first get involved into this work?

First time I faced Android was when building an app for my own startup, with Android SDK 8. It was an amazing app that was draining battery from 100 to 0 in about 4 hours :)
The development felt right for me. I really enjoyed the mixture between UI, complex algorithms and the entire eco-system. I liked the opportunity to try various open source libraries. In general, the system flexibility was very appealing to me.
At the same time, I decided to learn more by helping others like me who want to become Android developers. This is how Android Academy was born. In a couple of years it became the largest mobile community in Israel, fully supported by Google.
In 2014 I closed my startup and joined another startup called Gett, which is an on-demand mobility company. Since I didn't haven any "official" Android experience besides my startup, I started as an Android Junior Developer and quite quickly became the Android Technical Lead.

## 2. What is your favorite thing about your job?

I have an amazing opportunity to build apps that are used by millions, and more than that- are used heavily. We have to deal with almost every major challenge existing in Android: from vast fragmentation to devices with insufficient storage. It's challenging, interesting and it gives me an opportunity to learn new things almost every single day. Moreover, I have an amazing team, of which I'm responsible for professional growth - which makes things much more interesting :)


## 3. Do you have any advice for someone interested in pursuing the same career?

The best advice would be - do no be afraid! Try, fail, try again and at the end you will succeed. It's a general advice but it's especially relevant in the Android world. Where you have so many ways to do things, you have so many ways to fail. The only possible way to pull through is to try and keep trying.

## 4. What is the most challenging part of your work, and what is the most rewarding one?

Supporting various devices is really a pain. You develop a feature, test it on at least 10 devices. Then, there is some device used by a couple hundreds of users, on which your app constantly crashes because some manufacturer decided to customize Android behavior.
The most rewarding part is when you release a new version to production, and your customers tell you that it's one of the best versions they remember.

## 5.Can you give us a sneak peek into your  GDG DevFest Ukraine talk? Why did you choose this subject?

If you like to fire alarms and do things in the background, it's the right time to think: Does you architecture fit well with Android 7.0? Does it still perform the way you want? or should you make some changes?
However, my talk we will be about Star Wars, and not about Doze mode. Yeah. Star Wars :)

## 6.How do you prefer to spend your free time?

If I had it... I'm working during the day and building my new startup at night and weekends. Additionally, I steal some time to visit different countries, spread my knowledge and just try to be helpful :)

## 7.What do you think will be the next big trend in the industry in the next few years?

The future is amazing. So many things are happening right now: electric cars, autonomous cars, AI, solar energy. I believe that us, humans, sooner or later will remain with no jobs to perform. No drivers, no doctors, no fisherman, no babysitters. The only thing we will be responsible for would be inventing the next big thing. Inventing the future.

## 8.In your opinion, what are the benefits of attending events like GDG DevFest Ukraine?

Knowledge and Networking. Getting the latest knowledge in cut edge technologies, connect with new people, find the next startup mates, and just have fun! :)


Btw, his dog also wants you to come on GDG DevFest Ukraine 2016!
