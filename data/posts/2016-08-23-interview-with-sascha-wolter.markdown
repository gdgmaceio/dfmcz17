## 1. Please, tell a bit about the work you do. How did you first get involved into this work?

Thanks to my passion for the ease of use for both developers and users (i.e. APIs/toolchain and user interfaces) and some talking skills I was asked to become a Developer Evangelist a few years ago. It’s great to be somehow in between all the disciplines dealing with technology and (!) people. This embraces topics like user experience, development, ideation, and business model generation. But from my heart I am still a developer and spend as much time as possible  programming software and tinkering with hardware.


## 2. What is your favorite thing about your job?

I guess, I love the combination of doing and telling – or, according to the maker scene spirit: Show and Tell. Evaluating technologies, creating prototypes and developing showcases in conjunction with the chance to demonstrate and discuss these in the public is an important part of my job. Best of all, the outcome either turns into real product or prevents wasting resources. My son asserted once that I would have the best job of the world, because I get paid for playing Xbox and meeting friends.

No, it's not always fun! For instance, my son realized now, that I often work through the nights and on weekends and that I have to travel a lot. Still interested? My fellow Christian Heilmann already did an excellent job in summarizing the essentials of Developer Evangelism with all pros and cons at http://developer-evangelism.com/.


## 3. Can you give us a sneak peek into your  GDG Devfest Ukraine talk? Why did you choose this subject?

<img src="/images/posts/wolter_1.jpg" style="width: 100%;"/>

I want to inspire, motivate, and empower for the Internet of Things. In this special session I would like to demonstrate the Internet in a physical way and provide you with a toolset for prototyping and projects. I will show you, how you can create your very own connected world that matters. Saying that means also to raise awareness for the anxieties and responsibility we all have.

## 4. How do you prefer to spend your free time?

<img src="/images/posts/wolter_2.jpg" style="width: 50%;"/>

I love to explore all kinds of gadgets, toys, and games – electronic and analog ones. Best of all, it is always somehow related to my job and it can be done together with my kids. Spending my spare time with my kids, family, and friends is very motivating and valuable for my work, because I can learn from them which helps to do my job with much more responsibility.


## 5. What do you think will be the next big trend in the industry in the next few years?

I think Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning will be the next big thing, because people more and more expect things to act smart and autonomous. I doubt an IoT solution of dozens if not hundreds of devices will ever be accepted in their entirety by the users as long as they have to deal with complex configurations, settings and rules.
Especially because more and more everyday things will turn into connected devices. Technologies weave themselves into the fabric of everyday life until they are indistinguishable from it.
I assume people like to deal with these things as they do with simple lifeforms. In my opinion, our world will be enriched with simple electronic lifeforms – virtual assistants like Siri and Cortana are just the beginning, every day things from toy dolls to ovens already behave quite similar.

## 6. In your opinion, what are the benefits of attending events like GDG DevFest Ukraine?

If you talk to more or less just the same people with a similar mindset each day, you miss a lot of inspiration. And another point of view always helps to ideate and innovate. Therefore, it is a great chance to meet people from other countries with other backgrounds. I am looking forward to learn from each other, to understand other ways of thinking, and to gather new inspirations.
