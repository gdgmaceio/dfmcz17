# 1. Please, tell a bit about the work you do. How did you first get involved into this work?

I'm a front-end engineer at the ed tech company called Brainly. It's a startup from my hometown that, in many ways, reassembles StackOverflow, but is targeted to school kids. We are building a platform which empowers children to help each other in understanding school material.

I've been building for the web since I first got access to the Internet over 12 years ago. At first I was involved in both back-end and front-end, but for the last three years I've been completely focused on the latter.

# 2. What is your favorite thing about your job?

Working in front-end is absolutely fascinating because of variety of challenges that you have to face each day. Code structure, performance, compatibility, UX, accessibility, load speed, choosing right tools, building perfect workflow - it's all part of my day.

# 3. Do you have any advice for someone interested in pursuing the same career?

Front-end often feels overwhelming for newcomers because of the variety of tools, frameworks and libraries available. My advice is to start with the bare bones web platform first. In my opinion it's crucial to be comfortable working with vanilla JavaScript, CSS and HTML, knowing how browser works and how to use browser DevTools.

# 4. What is the most challenging part of your work, and what is the most rewarding one?

Building an experience that looks and feels great on all screen sizes is definitely one of the most challenging aspects of my work. However, with enough time and a dedicated team it's absolutely possible to build something that is both useful and fun to use. Seeing people enjoy software that you built is always the ultimate reward.

# 5. Can you give us a sneak peek into your  GDG DevFest Ukraine talk? Why did you choose this subject?

My presentation is about progressive web apps (PWA), the new, powerful bred of web apps. We will talk in length about service worker, implementing push notifications and the new 'Application' panel in Chrome DevTools.
Web is extremely successful on desktop and with PWAs we have a great opportunity to conquer mobile. What we need now is to spread awareness about this technology and start using it, hence my talk!


# 6. How do you prefer to spend your free time?

When I'm not playing with my daughter or enjoying board games with my friends I'm usually working on open source projects. Contributing to OSS is a fantastic way to learn something new and work with people from around the world.

# 7. What do you think will be the next big trend in the industry in the next few years?

With all browser vendors on board and very positive response from web developers community I'm quite certain that progressive web apps will become very popular on mobile devices. I'm especially eager to see PWAs taking advantage of Physical Web and Web Bluetooth.

# 8. In your opinion, what are the benefits of attending events like GDG DevFest Ukraine?

For me conferences were always about meeting people. You can watch the talks on the Internet later on, but being able to meet new likeminded people, hear about their accomplishments, exchange ideas and discuss common issues that we are facing at work is a solid reason to come.
