Since 1997, DataArt has built a scalable and resilient operation: proprietary R&D, strong financial position, solid infrastructure, and outstanding development teams in the U.S., UK, Central & Eastern Europe, and Latin America. To every project, we bring a combination of industry knowledge, unique company culture and some of the best technical talent in the world. Our clients' business outcome is the true measure of our success and pushes us to find creative solutions to the most difficult problems.

Rooted in deep domain knowledge and technology expertise, our offering includes new product design, enterprise system modernization, and managed services. Our collective experience spans over a thousand projects for some of the world's leading brands in the financial services, healthcare, travel & hospitality, media, telecom, and IoT sectors, including 3D Robotics Inc., Samsung, McGraw-Hill Financial, OCADO, Coller Capital, wot.io, Zesty and Booker among others.

We're a tribe of diverse, smart, intelligent people and we strive to make our clients and our employees happy. DataArt distinguishes itself from other companies with a special corporate culture: we don't have a rigid hierarchy, there is no bureaucracy and no particular dress code (unless we have clients visiting); we provide a flexible work schedule, an option to relocate to another office (temporary or permanently) at an employee's request, and a well-developed continuing education system.

DataArt hires people for the long haul: projects change, but the company remains and provides its employees with a solid infrastructure and professional development tools. Our team members appreciate curiosity, independence, and tolerance. We prefer trust to micromanagement. DataArt offers attractive benefits packages, including health insurance, vacation and relocation plans, fruit and coffee in the office as well as table tennis, game consoles, and other recreational activities.
