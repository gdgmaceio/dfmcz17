Speakers
---------
All this 32 guys they are real Nerds! Well experienced armed with knowledges and obsessed with Google technologies. They make your life easier,  things work faster  and make your mind blow with all this information!  Moreover, high concentration of Google Developers experts in one place is just crazy. And anyway, you can get a chance to talk face-to-face with experts at DFUA with whom you can share your ideas and get priceless advices, or just take a selfie :)

<div class="highlight-blockquote"> Such live event as DFUA force you to break out of your comfort zone. It’s easy to read a blog post from the privacy of your own office. You won’t break a sweat listening to a podcast (unless you’re on the treadmill.) You don’t have to make small talk while your YouTube video loads up. While there are those among us who are born networkers, for many of us live events, and other people, can be a challenge. But breaking out of our comfort zones is just the type of action we need to take to break out of old ways of thinking that have got us in a rut in our jobs. </div>

Lviv - historical place of Europe and culture soul of Ukraine
-------------------------------------------------------------
Pretty terrific city! If you comes here one time you have to return and stay here for all your life! I am not joking Lviv is dangerous (it makes you want to return again and again and again). Lviv is obsession!
