[Zalando](http://zln.do/2bHWAvA) is transforming from an e-commerce company into a multi-service platform that provides fashion as a service for 19+ million customers. We make it our mission to imagine and predict the infinite points of interaction between fashion and people - and develop the technology to make them possible. The 1,300+ members of Zalando Technology based in Germany, Ireland and Finland build most of our 40+ platform products in-house and open source - from our logistics software to our mobile applications. We work in Scala, Java, Clojure, Spark, React, Swift, and Docker - to name just a few. Our tech architecture is based upon five key principles: API First, REST, SaaS, cloud, and microservices.

When it comes to how we work, we believe that trusting each other is key. Through our culture of Radical Agility, we let the principles of Autonomy, Mastery and Purpose guide us. Our 110+ engineering teams are made up of over 70 nationalities. Diversity is a major factor to our success - from the variety of skill sets and interests to the tools and languages our teams choose to use.

We are passionate about what we do and have fun doing it.
