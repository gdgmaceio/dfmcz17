How about spending 15 min counting up all the steps in Lviv City Hall? Getting to the top may be quite a challenge, but it’s totally worth it! Another amazing place to climb, which will take your breath away, is a tower of Church of Sts. Olha and Elizabeth — majestic neo-Gothic building, definitely a must-see!

Lviv High Castle can be both a major disappointment and biggest surprise to you! Why disappointment? Because despite its promising name, the place is not that high (unless 413 m is impressive for you) and has no castle whatsoever. Why surprise?
